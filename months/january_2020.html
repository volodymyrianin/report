                The total VAG rework is in progress. For now <a class="link-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> brand is in work. The primary goal of the rework is to add all the Engines according to official brochures with the accurate Model Codes, rewriting the rules using Model and Engine Codes. This process is quite time consuming, however, it would benefit our website a lot, especially when we have more markets and users with the VAG cars with international engines.

The rules are already rewritten according to the engine and model codes. However, there are still some international engines that we are adding to have 100% accurate data. You may check the rules structure here. Fortunately, for the latest Golf generations there is some logic in model codes, so we may use the standard pattern for it. (in comparison, we had to write down all the possible model codes for the older generations, which is quite long and boring :p )

                Chevrolet is one of the crown jewel and an icing on GM's cake. Moreover, it's the largest American brands that features hell a lot of regional subsidiaries with completely different lineups across those. I like Canadian Chevrolet subsidiary the most, since it features pretty different lineup of series and sub-series which is drastically different to what American Chevrolet offered. However, Chevrolet is a key to the whole GM-brands, since the lifespan patterns, chassis and engines are shared among the whole range of brands constituting GM per se. Thus having Chevrolet covered means at least some template for other brands.

                Just as usual, you can check overall progress <a class="link-link" href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AkVe6Omg6XmxgbAjr4JQkCU4WUmhcQ">here</a>. I've included a new sheet with table legend for better convenience. Yellow cells denote tier-2 (manily LADM) series, which will be added as soon as the priority ones are done. I'm currently right on track on track with retrofits being implemented. The progress is severely hampered by crappy Transport Styrelsen VIN-code data (they are prone to misplasing crucial VIN-symbols or truncating the whole segments of VIN), thus, besides proper VIN-based AMR-rules, I'm forced to create monstrous fallback AMR-rules (I call those tier-2 rules) relying on model name field in order to cover those idents whose VIN data is completely screwed up. 
                In addition, there's a rule of a thumb while dealing with American cars: don't ever forget about Canadian market and fleet orders. I've lost some some time having loosened my grips on this rule applying Chevelle retrofits. I was forced to go back                and rewise some generation in order for those to incorporate Canadian lineups and police special models.

              I've been heavily involved with Chevrolet mid-size lineup retrofits this month. Chevy Intermediates feature mind-blowing lineup of subseries and late model-year performance variations additions. I had to cross-check numerous sources to come up with proper lineup of both Chevelles and El Caminos.

The model years comprising a generation have been turned into standalone generations. The following intermediate series have been              completely covered: <a class="link-link" href="https://www.car.info/en-se/chevrolet/chevelle">Chevelle</a> and <a class="link-link" href="https://www.car.info/en-se/chevrolet/el-camino">El Camino</a>.

                  As a result the number of unconnected idents has decreased by further ~15%. We are on the brink of breaching 450 unconnected idents threshold. I'm planning on covering non full-size Chevrolet series remaining, i.e. Corvair, Chevy II, Canaro and Corvette and swithinng on to full-sizers. In addition I need to research on and cover Canadian non full-sizers by GM based on corresponding Chevy models, i.e. Acadian and Beaumont cars.

                In general, all the tasks related to specifications are perfomed well. The 150 list is updated after ident import and it's followed by some of the employees.

                Added "min" and "max" values for "Dimensions and Weights", it will help to fill in the info more correctly to trim packages.
Information for the new cars, press-images and "first" core-specs are perfomed well.
Double research of all the specifications what we have. Re-checking the new cars (at least from 2019 year), re-filling in the info from Swedish sources.
Checking new generations from 2018, making a double research for core and expanded specs for top 20 brands.
Plus, finally the feedbacks from "Blocket" are back, so we can observe where we have problems and finding the solution to fix it.
The work is going well, everyone knows what to do. Any of the problems are being fixed quickly and also if there's necessity of the new specs, after discussion we also add them.

                New generations and facelifts of some brands presented before the Chicago Auto Show were created. With the help of Vladimir Martiniv and Vitaliy Kuzmenko, press pictures were uploaded and the available specifications for them were filled.
                  Missing engines were added in the latest generations of brands, which gradually represent one by one.
                  Extended 2020 for those engines that are still produced unchanged.

                Studies and changes were carried out on mild hybrids, which were originally created as ordinary gasoline and diesel.
                Also l renamed engines of such brands as Lamborghini, Pagani, Ruf and McLaren (Removing short engine names and adding special model names).
                The 90th Geneva International Motor Show will be held next month, so many new cars are expected to be presented. I will follow the latest news and make changes as new official information becomes available. We will also wait for photos from this                 auto exhibition, connect and process them.
